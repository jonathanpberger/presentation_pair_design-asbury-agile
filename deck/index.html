<h1>How is design different for Agile?</h1>

<ul>
<li>engineers build more quickly (and change it more rapidly)</li>
<li>demands on design are very different than what most designers are accustomed to.</li>
<li>execution is only part of the game; we do enablement too</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>How to make design for agile successful?</h2>

<ul>
<li>focus on the right questions,</li>
<li>keep pace with our engineers,</li>
<li>build beautiful, functional product,</li>
<li>enable clients to do the same.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Why Pair Design?</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Better Design</h2>

<ul>
<li>reduce the cost of change</li>
<li>encourage convention, reduce trivial decisions</li>
<li>reduces waste</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Better Designers</h2>

<ul>
<li>promotes learning</li>
<li>knowledge-transfer</li>
<li>continuous improvement</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Better Teams</h2>

<ul>
<li>It helps teams to start from a shared foundation,</li>
<li>to make creative decisions collaboratively,</li>
<li>to externalize and validate thinking,</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Better Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li>fresh eyes</li>
<li>mesh complementary skill sets</li>
<li>better Bus Count</li>
<li>easier ramp-up</li>
<li>facilitate rotation</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Better Product</h2>

<ul>
<li>to optimize for progress (not perfection)</li>
<li>to remove individual ego</li>
<li>promote shared ownership of product</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>How do we Pair design?</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Pivotal Labs Design practice employs many of the same techniques and philosophies that have made our engineering practice so successful over the years.</li>
<li>While design is a different medium than development,</li>
<li>the core principles of communication and tight feedback loops remain.</li>
<li>Pair design takes a few forms. The three major standbys are:</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>&quot;Synth/Gen&quot; Whiteboard pairing</h2>

<ul>
<li>two people, one marker (cursor)</li>
<li>&quot;Generator&quot; has the marker in hand, and tends to come up with ideas.</li>
<li>&quot;Synthesizer&quot; stands back, asking questions, probing, thinking of edge cases, keeping the big picture in context.</li>
<li>map out feature sets or user-flows at about the epic level of granularity.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Medium-Fidelity Illustrator Pairing</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>When?</h3>

<ul>
<li>whiteboard-fidelity is no longer sufficient to make design decisions,</li>
<li>two visual designers building a visual design system,</li>
<li>i.e. building a visual metaphor for the object domain that they&#39;re mapping onto the product.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>How?</h3>

<ul>
<li>two mice plugged into one copy of illustrator, trade off control of the cursor</li>
<li>The designers discuss the design challenge, occasionally turning to the computer to test out a feeling, illustrate an idea, or enshrine a decision.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Stylesheet Pairing</h2>

<ul>
<li>often called &quot;cross-functional pairing&quot;; that&#39;s a misnomer</li>
<li>two designers in the text editor, in the browser, working on markup</li>
<li>enshrine design decisions and implement them on the front end of the site</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Pairing also introduces advantages which aren&#39;t available to solo design.</h1>

<ul>
<li>When designing in front of working software (rather than static mock-ups), designers are able to generatively experiment and design in real-time.</li>
<li>They can play more easily and natively with interactions, make changes at full-fidelity, and be creative in a way that&#39;s impossible in a mock-up.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Cross-functional pairing</h2>

<ul>
<li>there&#39;s an interesting difference that happens when you start to employ cross functional pairing.</li>
<li>When you&#39;ve got two designers pairing together there&#39;s gonna be some skill transfer but similar perspective</li>
<li>When you sit a designer down next to a developer, that starts to change and you start to do a lot more skill transfer,</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>Benefits of x-fct&#39;l</h3>

<ul>
<li>because the designer is working directly on the full-fidelity software, there&#39;s no need to reproduce the design in mock-ups (a time-consuming task),</li>
<li>because the work is being done directly on the app, there&#39;s no time spent marking up (on the designers part) and decoding (on the developers part) redlines (both time-consuming tasks),</li>
<li>because they&#39;re pairing and having a conversation, the developer learns the rationales behind the design decisions.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the designer and developer are taken from an adversarial context (&quot;You didn&#39;t implement my design correctly!&quot; or &quot;this design is inconsistent / bad / not worth the effort&quot;) to a collaborative context, which contributes to unit cohesion, a better bus-count, and collective ownership of the product.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>Troubleshooting techniques: Soloing</h1>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Converge / Diverge / Converge</h2>

<ul>
<li>hit an impasse?</li>
<li>diverge for a short time (usually 10-30 minutes) to work through ideas on their own</li>
<li>re-converge, presenting their explorations, and continuing to work the design.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Exquisite Corpse</h2>

<ul>
<li>surrealist literary parlor game</li>
<li>set a short timer (usually 10-30m), work on a design direction, and then pass it off to the next designer.</li>
<li>Alternately, designers can forego the timer and just say &quot;ready?&quot; when they&#39;re stuck.</li>
<li>Ideally, several revolutions are completed each hour, allowing for rapid iteration, idea generation, and refinement.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Double-Speed Documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Once made, design decisions often have to be documented.</li>
<li>Design pairs will split up to create the <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/minimum-viable-deliverable/">Minimum Viable</a> <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/dry-documentation">DRY documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Because there are two designers, they deliver in half the time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>When do we pair?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Dev == 100% pairing, design &lt;100%</li>
<li>Pairing is valuable whenever design decisions are being made,</li>
<li>documenting decisions made by the pair: divide and conquere (2x speed for the dull stuff!)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Balanced Team &amp; Pairing</h2>

<ul>
<li>these are not existential claims</li>
<li>It&#39;s not  &quot;I am a developer I was born that way&quot; or trained that way,</li>
<li>it is &quot;my role on this project developer or designer&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<ul>
<li>Product people tend to be on the more interdisciplnary side</li>
<li>formally speaking on our projects their first obligation is to make sure the backlog is groomed and healthy</li>
<li>and the rest of the team can have a healthy conversation around &quot;what do we need to do next? What does that look like? How&#39;s it enshrined?&quot;</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<ul>
<li>When pairing with product designers via Synth-Gen,</li>
<li>two people at the whiteboard trading off between high level generative ideas</li>
<li>and a more strategic Step-Back, Higher- Level view of &quot;How do these ideas comport with the rest of our system?&quot;</li>
<li>that&#39;s something that product for the most part can drop into any piece of.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<ul>
<li>Product tends to be pretty good feedback for some of the illustrator pairing that we&#39;ll do</li>
<li>they may be less formally trained, they may have less of a sense of color theory,</li>
<li>but generally being able to talk through user flows is something that we&#39;ll do then and those interactions can be aided by product.</li>

<h2>Why Pair Design?</h2>

<p>Pair design enjoys many benefits which come over unchanged from pair programming: pairing reduces the cost of change, creates predictability, reduces waste, and promotes learning, knowledge-transfer, and continuous improvement.  It helps teams to start from a shared foundation, to make creative decisions collaboratively, to externalize and validate thinking, to optimize for progress (not perfection), to remove individual ego and promote shared ownership of product.</p>

<h1>Practice</h1>

<h3>&quot;Synth/Gen&quot; Whiteboard pairing</h3>

<p>It&#39;s very common to pair at the whiteboard: two Pivots, one marker. The &quot;Generator&quot; has the marker in hand, and tends to come up with ideas. The &quot;Synthesizer&quot; stands back, asking questions, probing, thinking of edge cases, keeping the big picture in context. This technique is frequently used to map out feature sets or user-flows at about the epic level of granularity.</p>

<h3>Medium-Fidelity Illustrator Pairing</h3>

<p>When whiteboard-fidelity is no longer sufficient to make design decisions, two designers will sit down at a single copy of Adobe Illustrator (or Photoshop, or Sketch or the like) and work on the design together. This greatly resembles pair programming, and they&#39;ll trade off control of the cursor just as pair programmers do. The designers discuss the design challenge, occasionally turning to the computer to test out a feeling, illustrate an idea, or enshrine a decision. When they hit an impasse, they may split up for a short time (usually 10-30 minutes) to work through ideas on their own before converging again, presenting their explorations, and continuing to work the design.</p>

<h3>Two-keyboard &quot;Cross-functional&quot; Code pairing</h3>

<p>When it&#39;s time to implement design, &quot;Cross-functional pairing&quot; is a misnomer when two designers pair together on code, but the name stuck. While it&#39;s usually untested,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.andersramsay.com/2011/09/26/cross-functional-pairing/">http://www.andersramsay.com/2011/09/26/cross-functional-pairing/</a></p>

<h3>Cross-Functional pairing</h3>

<p>Cross-Functional pairing usually describes a designer and a developer pairing together on styling and front-end code. Pairing across disciplines is crucial for good communication across teams. The knowledge-sharing benefits of cross-functional pairing tend to be even more pronounced than during intra-disciplinary pairing.</p>

<p>Traditionally, a designer painstakingly creates a pixel-perfect high-fidelity static mockup, then hands it off to the developer who builds the software, after which the designer looks for errors and red-lines the result. Then, the developer would amend the software to match the redlines, the designer would review the result, and the process would repeat until the designer was satisfied (or exhaustion set in). This process is slow, siloed, and adversarial.</p>

<p>By contrast, cross-functional design pairing sits the designer and the developer together at the keyboard to style the software. This has several economies and advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>because the designer is working directly on the full-fidelity software, there&#39;s no need to reproduce the design in mock-ups (a time-consuming task),</li>
<li>because the work is being done directly on the app, there&#39;s no time spent marking up (on the designers part) and decoding (on the developers part) redlines (both time-consuming tasks),</li>
<li>because they&#39;re pairing and having a conversation, the developer learns the rationales behind the design decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Developers are also learning general design theory which helps them make better design decisions when designers aren&#39;t available. Meanwhile, the designer learns about the relative cost of implementing various design strategies in the application. They also learn more about implementation, which helps them make design decisions which better fit the technology when developers aren&#39;t around.</p>

<p>So far we&#39;ve only described the efficiencies of Cross-Functional Pairing which make it cheaper and more effective than solo design. Pairing also introduces advantages which aren&#39;t available to solo design. When designing in front of working software (rather than static mock-ups), designers are able to generatively experiment and design in real-time. They can play with interactions, make changes at full-fidelity, and be creative in a way that&#39;s impossible in a mock-up. Furthermore, the designer and developer are taken from an adversarial context (&quot;You didn&#39;t implement my design correctly!&quot; or &quot;this design is inconsistent / bad / not worth the effort&quot;) to a collaborative context, which contributes to unit cohesion, a better bus-count, and collective ownership of the product.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Some solo techniques include:</p>

<h3>Double-Speed Documentation</h3>

<p>Once made, design decisions often have to be documented. Design pairs will split up to create the <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/minimum-viable-deliverable/">Minimum Viable</a> <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/dry-documentation">DRY documentation</a>. Because there are two designers, they deliver in half the time.</p>

<h3>Exquisite Corpse</h3>

<p>The name Exquisite Corpse is taken from the surrealist literary parlor game of the early 20th century in which &quot;players draw in turn on a sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the drawing, and then pass it to the next player for a further contribution&quot;. In exquisite corpse, designers will set a short timer (usually 10-30m), work on a design direction, and then pass it off to the next designer. Alternately, designers can forego the timer and just say &quot;ready?&quot; when they&#39;re stuck. Ideally, several revolutions are completed each hour, allowing for rapid iteration, idea generation, and refinement.</p>

<h3>Diverge / Converge</h3>

<p>SOMETIMES WE&#39;LL BREAK OUR PAIR, WORK ON SOMETHING SOLO FOR ~20M OR WHEN WE GET STUCK, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, AND THEN RECONVENE.</p>
