<h1>How can Pair Design help set up the teams to ensure collaboration?</h1>

<h1>hi!</h1>

<p>I&#39;m Jonathan Berger the associate director designer at Pivotal Labs and I&#39;ve been here six years.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>I&#39;ve worked on about thirty projects which means about thirty cross functional teams.
That often includes engineering product and design in various capacities.
One of the things that we&#39;ve borrowed from the Aglie engineering process that&#39;s been really helpful for cross-functional collaboration is pairing.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>So traditionally pairing two developers sitting down together to do a few things.
One of them is knowledge transfer.
Another is to reduce bus count, or rather risk around bus count, which is to say that we want to spread so much knowledge about the project around that we&#39;ll lower the number of people who need to get hit by a bus before the project is irretrievably lost because too much silo&#39;d knowledge is splattered</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>How does pairing differ with design and product?</h2>

<p>So we&#39;ve been doing test-driven development for a long time
that&#39;s led to pair programing for a long time
with the advent of product and design practice at labs we&#39;re starting to find other modes for pairing.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>It&#39;s a little more difficult to do Red Green Refactor or Ping-Pong pairing
(which are our standard development methodologies)when there&#39;s no testing to be done or no computer code be written.
We have a few kind of traditional modes for design pairing.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Synth-gen</h2>

<p>The first one being what we borrowed from Cooper who&#39;s been doing design pairing for many years.
They call it synthesizer generator paring or &quot;synth-gen&quot; pairing.
So generally you&#39;re going to have one person who&#39;s very focused on creating things; this is the generator.
So they&#39;re going to be  kind of blank slate, blank canvas looking to generate a lot of different possibilities.
The synthesizers gonna step back a little and try to look to them with more of a navigational view and kind of say &quot;Ok, that&#39;s an intersting idea, how&#39;s that going to comport with the rest of what we&#39;ve discussed?&quot; blah blah blah um so that&#39;s a mode that generally involves one marker two people at the whiteboard and you might have just one synth for the whole process or you
[Speaker 4] may have the
[Speaker 1] too since I&#39;ve been Generator and the Synthesizer trading off but we usually do this when —in fact we try to do all pairing when decisions need to be made— so if we&#39;ve already made design decisions which we regard the fundamental unit of our practice; when we need to come up design decisions one when we make design decisions and it&#39;s time to enshrine them we&#39;ll often divide conquer.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Illustrator pairing</h2>

<p>So another mode is two mice plugged into one copy of illustrator.
two visual designers building a visual design system, 
i.e. building a visual metaphor for the object domain that they&#39;re mapping onto the product.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>So you&#39;ll sit there you&#39;ll have an open copy of illustrator, sketch or Photoshop or some graphics program.
One person will have a mouse and say &quot;I&#39;ve got an idea let me sketch this out for you&quot; and start working
the other designers similar to pair programming will say &quot;wait wait hold on, hold off on the mouse for a second, I&#39;ve got an idea&quot; 
and you&#39;ll riff back and forth and generate many different ideas before honing in on a visual system that&#39;s gonna support the application.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Stylesheet Pairing (aka &quot;cross-functional&quot;)</h2>

<p>two designers in the text editor, in the browser, working on markup and 
starting to enshrine these design decisions and implement them on the front end of the site.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>you&#39;ll often have designers cross- functionally pairing with developers as well for this sort of thing.
When we&#39;re working on CSS it&#39;s very easy for us to pair 
and it&#39;s very similar to our traditional pair-programming model which we&#39;re very compfortable with.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Cross-functional pairing</h2>

<p>there&#39;s an interesting difference that happens when you start to employ cross functional pairing.
When you&#39;ve got two designers pairing together there&#39;s gonna be some skill transfer, 
there&#39;s gonna be some &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know that you could do this in CSS&quot; or &quot;Oh, that&#39;s an interesting way of structuring things.&quot; 
For the most part it&#39;s two designers who are coming from similar disciplinary background and 
that helps them have a similar literacy with the concerns that they&#39;re addressing.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>When you sit a designer down next to a developer, that starts to change 
and you start to do a lot more skill transfer, 
you start to educate a developer about how whitespace works or what a type scale is or color theory 
and it becomes a fundamentally different exchange </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>in that you are probably going little slower because you&#39;re needing to do some education 
but you&#39;re  probably getting a chance to challenge some assumptions, which can be a really powerful way of working.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Decision-making (when to pair)</h2>

<p>JEANA: It sounds like decisions are being made in pairs. How does that change the role of PM?
JPB: The Product Manager or the product owner is part of this Balanced team triumvarate.
So we&#39;ve got someone representing a technology, someone representing design, someone representing product </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>these are not existential claims 
It&#39;s not  &quot;I am a developer I was born that way&quot; or trained that way, 
it is &quot;my role on this project developer or designer&quot;.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Product people tend to be on the more interdisciplnary side 
formally speaking on our projects their first obligation is to make sure the backlog is groomed and healthy 
and the rest of the team can have a healthy conversation around &quot;what do we need to do next? What does that look like? How&#39;s it enshrined?&quot; </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>When pairing with product designers via Synth-Gen, 
two people at the whiteboard trading off between high level generative ideas 
and a more strategic Step-Back, Higher- Level view of &quot;How do these ideas comport with the rest of our system?&quot; 
that&#39;s something that product for the most part can drop into any piece of.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Product tends to be pretty good feedback for some of the illustrator pairing that we&#39;ll do 
they may be less formally trained, they may have less of a sense of color theory, 
but generally being able to talk through user flows is something that we&#39;ll do then and those interactions can be aided by product.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Pairing on story-writing</h2>

<p>Product also ends up doing a lot of pairing on story writing.
sitting down and dialectically saying &quot;well, as the user when I go to the item page and I tap the Add Item To Cart button, and the pair of the Product Owner can say &quot;well wait a minute, does that need to be on the item page? Can we have that on the index view?&quot; 
you get this back and forth that helps write stores</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>How is Cross-functional pairing crucial to running a lean team?</h1>

<p>Cross-functional Pairing is crucial to running a lean team 
because it helps reinforce not only personal relationships and trust among the team 
and high trust environments are the only environments in which agile and lean methodologies can really work at speed.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Cross functional pairing helps on a few axes.</h2>

<p>One axis is bus count 
which is to say &quot;how many people on your project need to get hit by a bus before you&#39;re irretrievably hosed?&quot; </p>

<p>Another axis that we like to talk about is Knowledge Share.
you end up starting a project maybe not knowing that much about visual design, 
but by talking to designers you&#39;re learning and adding to your skill set </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>that not only helps you with a lower cost of change for building things— 
you can now look at a mock up without a visual designer next to you and have a better idea of some of the &quot;why&quot; behind it, 
rather than just the &quot;what&quot;.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>You can also bring those opinions and knowledge to what you&#39;re doing in the future 
and when there isn&#39;t a designer around, when you have to make a guess on your own 
you&#39;re more informed to do that.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>[Speaker 3] What does it look like for Agile and Lean to play together in one process?</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>What does it mean for Agile and Lean to be put together a long process?</h1>

<p>I think that they work in concert very nicely.
Lean came out of the unification of Agile development methodologies and customer development methodology and 
Lean really speaks to &quot;how can we make sure that we&#39;re building the right thing as early quickly with as much confidence possible&quot;?</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<!-- # Transcript - jpb-w-jma-2.mov -->

<p>It&#39;s all about the feedback loops. // #00:00:03.3#
The question, I&#39;ll start it over, is &quot;how do lean and agile metho&#39;ys work together? #00:00:13.4#</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h1>How do Lean and Agile work together?</h1>

<p>Agile is a foundational part of lean.
Lean came about in a melding of Agile Software Meth, Customer dev meth, Toyata prod system lean, notions of &quot;let&#39;s reduce waste.&quot; 
What I generally find is that lean techniques—these are a couple of big toolboxes.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Very few projects are going to be #00:00:35.8#  orthodox, doctrinaire, going down a checklist.
Where I find value in lean, where I find value in agile, is building these toolkits 
that are full of tools that&#39;re optimized for short feedback loops and tend to work well and in concert with each other.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>The Lean Toolbox</h2>

<p>The Lean toolbox tends to have a lot of tools for figuring out &quot;hey, are we building the right thing?&quot; whether at the feature level of granularity or the product level of granularity, as quickly as possible.
We often find when we&#39;re kicking off a project for instance, we&#39;ll want to have a number of lean hypotheses. &lt;!-- #00:01:12.7# --&gt;
i.e., &quot;We believe that BLAH type of user has BLAH type of problem and we can fix it with BLAH type of solution and we&#39;ll know we&#39;re right if BLAH type of metric changes.&quot; #00:01:21.9#</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>This is pretty lightweight, it&#39;s pretty doctrinaire in that it&#39;s a structured format, 
but we can come up with one of these or many of these for any feature suggestion or product suggestion, 
and that helps us back out to an MVP, i.e. &quot;what&#39;s the least amount of work we can do to validate this?&quot;. &lt;!-- #00:01:42.2# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Once we feel that we have some validation we&#39;ll start building, 
and the Agile toolkit comes into play.
We&#39;re going to start doing a lot of pair-programming, TDD, and try to build software that optimizes for low Cost-of-Change </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>so that we&#39;re able to take the pieces of it that are validated 
and toss the pieces that aren&#39;t 
and replace them with new experiments that we&#39;ll subsequently validate. &lt;!-- #00:02:30.9# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Q: Can you be more specific about how TDD would work in a lean feedback loop?</h2>

<p>TDD optimizes for robust software that has a low cost of change. &lt;!-- #00:02:57.4# --&gt;
When we&#39;re doing Lean validation cycles: building software, standing it up really quickly, and getting it in front of ppl, 
TDD does two main things: </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>one, it limits the amount of engineering involved, which turns into death by 1000 cuts when you start pre-optimzing.
Rather than death by 1000 cuts, we&#39;re confining things to the just the amount we need to do to make the tests pass.
That&#39;s reducing waste. &lt;!-- #00:03:51.5# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>We&#39;re also protecting ourself by having a regressions suite, which lowers the cost of change.
We have our first idea of what the product should be, we build it in a test-driven manner, we put it out in the world, 
and we find that certain parts work and certain parts aren&#39;t.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>TDD allows us to take those parts that aren&#39;t working out 
and have confidence that we&#39;re not going to break the rest of the software that is working.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>The Build-Measure-Learn loop and Pairing &lt;!--  #00:05:19.6# --&gt;</h2>

<p>Build is straightforward: agile software dev, TDD, pairing, to build whatever software we&#39;re talking about.
THen it goes out in the world and we&#39;re measuring.
The measurements are going to take the form of more than one person: a user (using the software) and a product team evaluating it.
I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s pairing going on there, but there&#39;re definitely conversations.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Is Every Act of Collaboration &#39;pairing&#39;?</h2>

<p>Is every act of collaboration &#39;pairing&#39;?&quot; 
Probably not.
If we go that loose, we lose some of the meaning of the term &#39;pairing&#39;, 
which is a fundamentally different act than just &#39;two people doing things together&#39;. &lt;!-- #00:06:15.3# --&gt;</p>

<!-- TODO: Answer _why_ pairing is different: rhythm, immediacy, etc,-->
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>The &quot;Learn&quot; loop, processing and synthesizing those measurements is also a collaboration.
We&#39;re often gonna see that in IPM, in story-writing, that often takes the form of the synthesizing pairing model.
We&#39;ll also often see that when two designers sit down together in Illustrator working through visual systems, there&#39;s a lot of reference to users feedback.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>I suppose pairing is present in all aspects of the BML loop, although to bastardize Bill Gibson, it&#39;s not distributed equally.
(I sneak that quote in everywhere I can). &lt;!-- #00:07:06.2# --&gt;</p>

<p>JMA: Yeah, it&#39;d be rude not to</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>how does cross-functional parking create trust? &lt;!-- #00:07:30.9# --&gt;</h2>

<p>Trust is created and facilitated by cross-functional pairing 
in a way that I don&#39;t tend to see have grown as quickly or robustly as other models of interaction.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>When you pair w/ someone
—this is maybe the thing that characterizes pairing from just collaboration in the abstract—
when devs pair, it&#39;s not enough to have one keyboard that you pass back and forth. You have two keyboards plugged in.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>This sounds a little trivial, 
but youre reducing friction 
to the level that you get native levels of literacy.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>It&#39;s an honest-to-god conversation back-and-forth, 
the same way you and I might have a conversation verbally and both be empowered to speak, 
to use communication cues, pauses, visual cues, to know when you can interject.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>The same things start to happen when two keyboards are plugged into one machine, 
in a way that you don&#39;t see in other models of interaction. &lt;!-- #00:08:31.5# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>That&#39;s why we&#39;ll have two mice plugged into one copy of Illustrator.
We&#39;ve learned that two markers at the whiteboard don&#39;t do a good job of handing control off.
It&#39;s an analogue to a cursor.
When there&#39;re two of us at the white board, there&#39;s one cursor. &lt;!-- #00:08:43.9# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Pairing is more than collaborating</h2>

<p>What happens when you&#39;re pairing and not just collaborating, 
both people are equal partners in the interaction.
Often you&#39;ll have different skill levels, but that&#39;s ok.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Pairing started as continuous code review
you&#39;d often have a very senior member paired with a junior, sitting together.
The  junior member would drive, the senior would talk them through what&#39;s going on.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>The way in which pairing facilitates trust 
is that it&#39;s letting two practitioners, even if they come from different disciplines, come as equal partners to a conversation.
Not to say they have equal knowledge or equal expertise, but they have an equal mandate to contribute. &lt;!-- #00:09:25.1# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>This working together is the most effective way I&#39;ve found to endanger trust 
because you&#39;re seeing where people perform and where they fall down.
You need to rely on them to deliver or re-articulate your vision.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>It&#39;s something that&#39; can&#39;t be faked.
The good news is that it&#39;s fun and engaging and high-quality.
The bad news is that it&#39;s enormously draining, it takes a lot of mental and emotional energy.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>We often find that when people start pairing full-time, they&#39;re exhausted for a month or two.
Their side-projects all die on the vine.
It often puts the lie to anyone who&#39;s BS&#39;ing their way through what they&#39;re doing. &lt;!-- #00:10:19.5# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>On the face it, that&#39;s a great thing.
Politically, that can occasionally be problematic in the context of a consultancy. &lt;!-- #00:10:42.9# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Q: Can you talk about being able to fall down and get back up? &lt;!-- #00:11:33.7# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>One of the ways that pairing helps facilitate robust teams and 
allow people to get back up after they&#39;ve fallen down, 
which in turn allows them to trust they can fail and it won&#39;t be catastrophic, 
which in turn allows them to experiment more freely, 
is the fact that interdisciplinary pairing does a better job of showing you what you don&#39;t know than almost anything else. &lt;!-- #00:12:00.2# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>When you&#39;re working with two practitioners w/in the same discipline, 
they tend to have similarly-shaped biases and experiences.
When you pair w/ people who come from different disciplines—in particular, disciplines which may be at cross-purposes, or may have natural dynamic tension between them—
it helps carve out more points of view and give you more of a full picture of the domain, the product, the methodology. &lt;!-- #00:12:34.2# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>When you come to the world you&#39;ve got the things you know and the terra incognita.
When you bring people in from another discipline and they come from another vantage point, 
they generally tend to see more of what you regard as terra incognita as part of their domain.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>What you know of the world may be the part they don&#39;t see, 
that trade off is one the real benefits of pairing.
By reducing the amount of completely unknown space 
you tend to get a lot of confidence, quickly, that your wingman (or woman) knows what to do. &lt;!-- #00:13:12.8# --&gt;</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Pairing helps facilitate lower cost-of-change, 
less catastrophic consequences of failure, 
which engenders better experimentation. &lt;!-- #00:13:31.6# --&gt;</p>
